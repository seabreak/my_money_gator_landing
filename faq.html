              <h3>How Is my information and data secured?</h3>
              <p>
                We use HTTPS protocol and other sophisticated security measures
                to send secure encrypted communications over the internet. This
                is the same protocol banks and other financial institutions use
                to protect your identity and data. You can view our certificate
                by clicking on the lock icon in your browser bar. You will know
                when you see the green bar in your browser bar that your
                connection is secure. Our servers are also equipped with
                the latest security measures to keep your information safe.

            <div class="question">
              <h3>Why should I use a cloud based program?</h3>
              <p>
                Many reasons:
                <ul>
                  <li>Your data is available anytime and anywhere from any device that is connected to the internet. </li>
                  <li>Backup of your data is automatic.</li>
                  <li>Costs to package and distribute software programs are reduced and this is a green element to cloud computing as the cost reductions are passed to you. </li>
                  <li>Upgrades to software are seamless and will not affect any of your data.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>Is this program mobile friendly?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, this program is responsive to all mobile devices.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>Do you have an App?</h3>
              <p>
                Maybe in the future.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>Why is one page bookkeeping different?</h3>
              <p>
                Your data is all right in front of you and you know where you are in the program.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>Do I need to choose an accounting method?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes. If you have filed a Schedule C in the past, you had to choose
                an accounting method for your business. If you don’t remember which
                method you chose, refer to that tax return. You can change the
                accounting method with approval from the IRS. For small businesses,
                we recommend using the cash method.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>What is the difference between Cash Basis and Accrual Basis accounting?</h3>
              <p>
                Using the cash method, revenue and expenses are recorded when they
                are received or paid. In accrual, revenues and expenses are recorded
                when they are earned and expenses capitalized in the year incurred.
                It is generally easier to close books and report annual income
                using the cash method and thus, most small business use the cash method.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
              <h3>How do I change my accounting method?</h3>
              <p>
                If you want to change your accounting method, you must generally
                get IRS approval and file Form 3115.
              </p>
              <p>
                See the instructions for Form 3115 on the IRS site.

            <div class="question">
              <h3>Why are you better than Quicken or all the others?</h3>
              <p>
                We designed the program’s interface to be the simplest bookkeeping
                program to learn and use. All entries are intuitive and you will
                love how this all flows together. This does not belie the fact
                that there are 1000s of lines of code that power this behind the scenes.
